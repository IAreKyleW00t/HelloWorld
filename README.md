HelloWorld is a simple and clean chatting app that utilizes [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for authentication and real-time messaging. The goal is to allow students (primarily in Computer Science) to join chatrooms for specific classes, allowing them to ask questions and easily communicate with other students who are also in the same class.
